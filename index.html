        <h5 class="review">25 July 2018</h5>
        
    <p class="review"> The classic Oregon Trail games of the 1980s and early 1990s are iconic of educational video games among Americans who went to school at those times. There are few Americans of that time, growing up in the age of heavy, boxy, metal desktop computers with pixels for graphics, who don't remember white oxen pulling a covered wagon across the land.<br><br> Then in 1995 MECC, the creators and publishers of the original Oregon Trail, gave a much-needed facelift to the 24-year old game. This version upgraded from maybe a dozen tracks of beeping and booping PC speaker music to at least a couple dozen music tracks composed with genuine instruments. Graphics went from 16-colour pixel sketches to photographic experiences. <br><br> Yes, experiences. Instead of looking at a single, small picture of a place as in the past, you could walk through Independence, MO; Fort Bridger, or a few dozen different towns, forts, and settlements. Within those towns you visit all manner of shops, and even click on people standing around and talk to them. It was like nothing before. <br> <br>
    Even the places you could only see in a single picture got better pictures. And the list expanded to hundreds of places, all portrayed in the realistic VGA beauty. Back in the day, it was as close as most of us got to actually seeing these landmarks; it was almost an accomplishment. <br><br>
    
    I could wax eloquent further. Suffice to say that this game has certainly captured my heart. Having grown up with both the classic Windows PC release of the original Oregon Trail, and Oregon Trail II, not only the technological advancement but also the freedom of choice allowed by the second sequel of this series compels me to play it from time to time. It is certainly enjoyable, even slightly thrilling, to travel through the rugged American West, and I enjoy doing so most with Oregon Trail II.

    <h2 id="Csr2">Caesar II</h2>
	<h5 class="review">25 July 2018</h5>
        <p class="review"> Impressions Games is the original company behind the second most famous city building series in the world's history. This series began in 1992 with their game "Caesar", a top-down city making game based in Ancient Rome. Fine though this game was, it really became iconic with the first isometric title in the series: Caesar II. <br> <br>
Caesar II is the first isometric game in the now beloved City Builder's series. It carried over some of the quirks from Caesar, such as most service buildings having intrinsic service radiuses, choosing scenarios from a map instead of following a campaign, and having a separate "province" screen. But it was the first game of the series to codify some staples of the series thereafter: walkers that serve buildings, voice acting, real, standardized music (in the Windows version), isometric graphics, and actual goals. (Before that, Caesar was basically a software toy like SimCity.)<br> <br>
It is definitely a transitory product; by 1996, Caesar III had finalised the basic shape of the city-building series, and all future titles would be slight (but welcome) improvements on that basic design. However, the definite leaps in quality made by Caesar II definitely prepare the way for the glory that was to come.  </p>a</td>
